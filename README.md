## Development

XCode is largely uncessary to build and use BBeeQ. Swift will suffice<sup>1</sup>.

<sup>1</sup> For now, including the live activity widget requires Xcode as there
is something in how the binary is built when using swift that doesn't match how
Xcode builds things. Everything builds fine, the live activity is just never
shown.

NOTE: To use notifications the app must be signed.
